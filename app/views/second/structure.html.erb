Information Architecture</br>
Organizing Content and Flow</br>
1. Organizational structure</br>
2. Labeling </br>
3. Navigation</br>
4. Search</br></br>

Content should be strategic</br>
 - Serve a goal, to deliver a message, or make them feel soemthing they can't get anywhere else</br>
 - Relevant</br>
 -- Our reason for being, reason why users come to our website, users should identify with it, content should convince users to take action</br>
 -Appropriate</br>
 -- Consistent in email and everywhere you're showing your message. Consistent tone and style</br>
 - Useful</br>
 -- Do they really need to know this. Is this unique. Is it blah blah. What's in it for me</br>
  appropriate and useful (users should be able to act)</br></br>

  5 states affect user context:</br>
  1. Physical: mobile devices, one hand or 2 hand, moving, doing other tasks?</br>
  2. Environmental: What's the room they're in like. Is it noisy, will someone interrupt them, is it a couch with a tablet?</br>
  3. Preferential: phone, desktop or tablet. Video or text. Physical disabilites.</br>
  4. Emotional: what's their stress level like. What's motivating their activity. What can't they live without.</br>
  5. Cognitive: what assumptions will they make. Ability to learn. Education level. Narrow or broad audience</br></br>


When grouping and labeling content strive for:</br>
  - Simplicity</br>
  - Accuracy</br>
  - Clarity</br>

  Grouping and classifying content:</br>
  - Chronological</br>
  - Alphabetical</br>
  - Geographical</br>
  - Most popular</br>
  - Process order (How to change a tire)</br></br>

  IA Models:</br>
  1. Hierarchical Tree</br>
  2. Nested lists</br>
  3. Hub and spoke model</br>
  4. Bento box</br>
  5. Filtered view</br>
  Tools: Word, Omnigraffle</br></br>

  Navigation:</br>
  - Primary. Content that most users want.</br>
  - Secondary. Content that doesn't serve the primary goal (i.e. Contact us)</br>
  - Global nav. Header menu that's present in every page</br>
  - Local nav. Only appears on category pages. Minimizes cognitive load</br>
  - Navigation based on user types. Know all the different types of users (admin, free trial, won games, etc)</br></br>

  Determining key navigation paths:</br>
  - How did I get here, what can I do next, where can I go from here</br>
  - Make sure users can get to where they want</br>
  1. Identify value prop. Is it clear why I should sign up?</br>
  - What do users want to happen, and what does the business want the user to do.</br>
  - How many valuable outcomes are there and how valuable is each one.</br>
  2. Identify direct paths to value. Is the path to that value obvious, can it be shorter</br>
  Make the path to value obvious and clear</br>
