WIREFRAMING:</br>
- Info priority</br>
- Labeling and categorizing</br>
- Layout and organization</br>
- Wayfinding mechanisms</br>
- How will users interact with what's being presented and how will the app respond</br></br>

A wireframe shows how it works not how it looks (not UI look and feel)</br>
- It must be as accurate as possible. Showing the real labels for content</br>
- It is a blueprint for design and development. It must communicate: Structure, content, info hierarchy, functionality and behavior</br>
- The costs of making changes here is low</br></br>

Tips for wireframing:</br>
- Start with sketches. No constraints. Don't judge. Do as many as you can (20-25)</br>
- Keep UI generic. Don't put real pictures. Don't use colors. It will distract</br>
- Consider real resolutions</br>
- Use real labels</br>
- Go past the happy path.</br>
