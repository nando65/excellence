Book(audio): The Great Courses - Argumentation: The Study of Effective Reasoning

Formal logic is not common in the real world. If A=B and B=C then A=C</br></br>

1. Audience based</br>
2. Uncertain</br>
3. Justification</br>
4. Risk of being convinced</br></br>

- Controversy-- Claim -- Link (warrant to support link) -- Supporting arguments -- Facts to support the supporting arguments</br></br>

1. Facts ("I didn't steal your car")</br>
2. Definition ("I borrowed your car)</br>
3. Justification ("I stole it to go to the hospital")</br>
3. Relevance ("Yes but it's no big deal")</br>
4. Forum (ex. "This is not the place to discuss this. Call my lawyer")</br></br>

Number of arguments</br>
Arrangement of argument</br></br>

Should I attack all the opponent's arguments and in which order?</br>
Attack the weakest link</br></br>

Should I focus on defending my argument that was attacked or should I attack my opponents arguments?</br>
It's hard to rebuild an argument. There are more options to attack. But if you attack you lose the goal of conveying your point. It's a balance</br></br>

All ---- Some ----- None</br></br>

To prove that the link between the claim and the evidence is valid, use these:</br>
1. Examples</br>
2. Analogies</br>
3. Signals (proxy) (Correlation)</br>
4. Cause</br>
5. Common places can also be considered as an accepted truth</br></br>

- Reductio at absurdum</br>
- If it applies for the lesser, than even more for the greater. If I don't pay insurance for my house, then no way I would pay it for my car</br>
- From the general to the specific and viceversa</br>
- Call out what the opponent is doing and just by doing that you weaken him</br></br>

When talking about signal (correlation) and causation, consider these:</br>
- Empirical prove that X causes Y. Two groups of people, one gets exposed to sun every day, and the other never gets exposed to sun. You can prove that sun cause cancer.(inethical in most cases)</br>
- Mathematically prove that one X causes Y. Regressions</br>
- Rethorical: the most used in arguments. Example: what is his motive.</br></br>

When determining if X caused Y:</br>
- Sometimes X happens before Y, but sometimes X happens and Y doesn't or Y happened without X happening.</br>
- Be careful, if X comes before Y it doesn't necessarily mean that X caused Y.</br>
- Random chance. Every president elected in year that end in zero die during their presidency. Even if there are a lot of examples and no counter example, it doesn't mean it is true. It can be random chance</br></br>
