Book: Getting things done</br></br>
1. Granularity when thinking about tasks. Don't think I have to clean the house. Say I need to mop the bathroom floor and vacuum the living room's carpet.</br>
2. Write down everything (every single task) that's on your mind. Don't rely on memory</br>
3. Have a system (Trello board) and look at it as many times as you want during the day.</br>
4. Depending on time that it takes and context, choose which task to do. Your subconscious knows what's important</br></br>

Book: Search for happiness by Bertrand Russell</br>
Don't think all day about a problem that you have. You will be half thinking it and it will deplete you of your energy. Instead dedicate 2 hours focused on the problem and then let your subconscious figure it out. Don't think about it anymore for some time and then come back to it.</br></br>
