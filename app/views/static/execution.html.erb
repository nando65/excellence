Reasons for misestimating times:</br></br>
1. Product complexity</br>
2. Lack of energy (motivation, lazy, sloppy)</br>
3. Rework</br>
4. External obstacles</br>
5. Staffing issues</br>
6. Lack of product understanding</br>
7. Lack of skills</br>
8. Bad project management (sense of urgency)</br>
9. Scope (wrong solution / not minimum version) - This doesn't affect estimates</br>
10. Slow decision making during execution, or changing decisions during execution</br>
11. Sequencing (riskiest and unknowns first)</br>
12. End-to-end MVP</br>
13. Coordination between different groups (i.e. Front end and back end coordination issues)</br>
14. Lack of clarity of what the end goal is</br>
15. Myopia - focusing too much on one part and forgetting the other</br>
16. No consequences for wrong estimates. No accountability</br>
17. The one who estimates is not the one who executes</br>
18. Engineer might want to make the rest of the team feel happy, so he or she underestimates</br>
19. The engineer wants to be extremely safe and comfortable so they overestimate</br>
20. The engineer gets sick, leaves on unplanned vacation or leaves the company</br>
21. Lack of understanding of the development process and all the phases (ie. didn't plan for cleanup)</br></br>
